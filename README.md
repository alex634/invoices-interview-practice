# invoices-interview-practice

A simple website for logging invoices. This should absolutely not be used in production.
The sole purpose was to practice JavaScript and ReactJS before an interview.

![Invoices](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07158298-38e5-49cc-80ef-5a0263381fce)

**Frontend:** ReactJS + MUI
**Backend:** Express.js

All data is stored in memory. Restarting the backend will erase all invoices.

# How to Use

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alex634/invoices-interview-practice.git
```

2. Open two terminals:

- Terminal 1: Go to the backend folder

```bash
cd invoices-backend
```

- Terminal 2: Go to the frontend folder

```bash
cd invoices-frontend
```

3. Install dependencies in both folders:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the App

- Start the backend:

```bash
npm run start
```

- Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If everything works correctly, the frontend terminal will display a link to the website, and you can start testing the app.
